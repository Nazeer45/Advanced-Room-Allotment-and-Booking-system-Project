Implemented "Advanced Room Allotment and Booking System" in C++ using object-oriented programming principles. 
The system allows users to perform various tasks related to conference room management, such as installation of rooms, 
reservation of seats, displaying vacant seats, and checking available rooms.

Key Features:

1) Installation of Rooms: Users can input room details including room number, host's name, start and end times of the session, and time duration.
2) Reservation of Seats: The system enables users to reserve seats in specified conference rooms. It checks for seat availability and allows the user to enter passenger names for the reserved seats.
3) Displaying Vacant Seats: Users can view the details of a specific conference room, including the host, start and end times, and a visual representation of the seat occupancy status.
4) Available Rooms: Provides a list of available conference rooms, displaying room numbers, hosts, and session timings.
5) User-Friendly Interface: The system utilizes a simple console-based interface, making it easy for users to navigate and perform actions.
